<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project
The goal of Code-Translation is to translate a program written in Python to C++. This can be highly valuable in many respects such as migrating ancient systems to newer ones or learning new programming languages. Here, we are exploring the technologies surrounding NLP and seeing how pre-existing ML frameworks can help us achieve our goal of code translation.
