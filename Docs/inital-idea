Goal/Vision: 
	== Research based project on getting to know more about how one can achieve code translation. Mainly looking more into NLP models potentially used to translate words from one (human) language to another based on the context and meaning of the word. We'll also be looking into computational resources needed to run complex ML models, such as GPU capabilities provided by AiMOS.
	== Focussing on python -> c++

Context Mapping of keywords
	== "Map" python keywords to c++ keywords
	Eg. 	def	<-->	function
		while	<-->	while
		for	<-->	for(..)
		elif 	<--> 	else if
		del	<--> 	delete
		True	<-->	true
	== Mapping of tokens/keywords based on what the context of the keyword is in the program. In such a way that two different 'for' loops can be interpreted differently depending on where in the code they're used
	== Technically, mapping of the context. Can also be expanded to context of code blocks as a whole (loops, functions, classes...)
	== Context? Where/how/when/why of a keyword or code block
